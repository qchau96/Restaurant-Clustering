# Best Location to Open A Restaurant in Manhattan

I have always dreamed of opening a restaurant one day in Manhattan, and was brainstorming if I can apply Data Science with my idea. Location is one of the most important factors to decide the success of a restaurant. To find the optimal place, I utilized [Foursquare API](https://foursquare.com/developers/signup) and K-Means Clustering, and [NYC Census Data](http://zipatlas.com/us/ny/zip-code-comparison/median-household-income.htm) for this project. My reasonings are based off number of competitions, spending power, and population across each neighborhood. It will still be far ahead in the future when I can open a restaurant but it was a really fun project for me.
